Explanation:
•	Users (250): Represents the platform's users who can create and manage their portfolios.
•	User Interface (UI): The front-end interface where users interact with the platform to view their portfolios, assets, and potentially add new assets.
•	Portfolio Management Service: The core service responsible for portfolio creation, calculation, and maintenance. It interacts with various components to fetch data, calculate portfolio value, and update the user interface.
•	User Account Service: Manages user accounts, authentication, and user-related information.
•	Portfolio Database: Stores user portfolio details, including asset holdings and historical data.
•	Asset Database: Stores information about available assets (stocks, mutual funds) like their names, symbols, and potentially basic descriptions. This can be integrated with the Portfolio Database if the data model allows.
•	Real-Time Data Store: Stores real-time asset prices received from external sources.
•	Price Data (External Sources): Represents external sources (e.g., financial APIs, market data feeds) that provide real-time or near real-time asset prices.
•	Market Data Feed: Continuously fetches and updates asset prices in the Real-Time Data Store, ensuring the system has the latest information.
•	Cache: (Optional) A layer that can be implemented to store frequently accessed data (e.g., recently retrieved asset prices) to improve performance and reduce load on external sources.
•	Notification Service: (Optional) Sends alerts or notifications to users about significant portfolio changes or price movements.
•	Alerting Service: (Optional) Monitors portfolio performance and triggers alerts based on pre-defined user preferences (e.g., price reaching a certain threshold).
Key Features:
•	Real-Time Updates: Utilizes a market data feed and real-time data store to ensure users see their portfolio value reflect the latest asset prices.
•	Scalability: Designed to handle an increasing number of users and assets.
•	Reliability: Emphasizes reliable data retrieval, processing, and storage for accurate portfolio calculations.
•	Data Refresh: Regularly updates portfolios based on a refresh schedule (every 10 minutes in this case).
This high-level design diagram ensures a clear representation of how each component interacts within the system, emphasizing scalability, real-time updates, and reliability.
